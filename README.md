Hello people, 

This week, I've had a project in WebGl where our must create a games.

Some constraints are present such : 

-> work alone 
-> use our spaceship made on Cinema 4D
-> an asset controled by player 
-> a score (the life of people)

And as for the rest of the project, we are free.

Normally, you don't have to download anything.

The goal of this game, it's to survive the longest time possible at the arrival of the planets. 
You have three life, and every time you collide with a planet, you lose one life.

When you test my first page index.html, you arrive in a page where you can see my home page.

If you click in "Accéder à l'aperçu du jeux", you can see the screenshot of my game.
And if you click in "Accéder au jeux", you arrive in my game where you just need to click and the game starte immediately.

If you don't know how to move to esquive the planets, don't worry you have the explications before to click and the pause key if you must be make anything.

I think everything is good to play in the best conditions.

If ever I made errors in my code and it does not work well, don't hesitate to contribute and help me.

Before to try my game, you must to know that my game don't fonctionne very well because I have some things to modify such the score and life which increase or decrease when they don't must. And the collision with planets. I think that in four working days, it's a good start.

Thanks and enjoy.
